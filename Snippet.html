    <h1> Snippet explanation</h1>
    <p>  The snippet we are going to examine is below. <br> // Want to search the web? Try <a href= "https://google.com" id= "the-best-link" class= "banana"  target= "blank"> Google </a> // </p>
    <p> Underneath the hood, this looks like: <xmp> Want to search the web? Try <a href= "https://google.com" id= "the-best-link" class= "banana"  target= "blank"> Google </a> </xmp>  </p>
    <p> Tags define how the browser formats and displays the page. They are denoted by <> to open and < /> to close.<br>  The tags present here are... </p>
        <dl>
            <dt>Paragraph Tag. Made by <xmp> ( <p> &  </p>) </xmp> </dt>
            <dd>-Formatts the snippet tag into a seperate line. </dd>

    <p> Nestling is when one tag is put within the umbrella of another one. This is oftentimes compared to parent-child relationships. <br> <br>So in our original snippet, the hyperlink tag is <em> nestled </em> within the paragraph tag which is also nestled under the overatching HTML tags</p>
    <p> Our snippet also contains attribute names within the Hyperlink tag. Attributes are used to refer to HTML elements so they can be modified using JS or CSS <br> <br> Our snippet has attributd values of... </p>
        <dl>
        <dt>ID</dt>
        <dd>-Creates a unique identifier for this element</dd>
        <dd>-Value of "the best link" </dd>
        <dt>Class</dt> 
        <dd>-Creats a class also to identify but does not have to be unique to this element</dd>
        <dd>-Value of "bannana"</dd>
        <dt>Target</dt> 
        <dd>-Specifies where to open the linked document</dd>
        <dd>-Value of "blank" so it opens it in a new window</dd>
       </dl>
