<p>Critics have derided US hegemony and its military bases as a form of imperialism</p>
<blockquote cite="https://www.democracynow.org/2010/11/22/chalmers_johnson_1931_2010_on_the">
    <i>A nation can be one or the other, a democracy or an imperialist, but it can’t be both.</i> If it sticks to imperialism, it will, like the old Roman Republic, on which so much of our system was modeled, lose its democracy to a domestic dictatorship.
</blockquote>

<blockquote cite="https://www.democracynow.org/2010/11/22/chalmers_johnson_1931_2010_on_the">
    Imperialism is a form of tyranny. It never rules through consent of the governed. It doesn’t ask for the consent of the governed. It is — <em>we talk about the spread of democracy, but we’re talking about the spread of democracy at the point of an assault rifle.</em>
</blockquote>

<blockquote cite="https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/king-papers/documents/beyond-vietnam">
    This business of burning human beings with napalm, of filling our nation’s homes with orphans and widows, of injecting poisonous drugs of hate into the veins of peoples normally humane, of sending men home from dark and bloody battlefields physically handicapped and psychologically deranged, cannot be reconciled with wisdom, justice, and love. <em>A nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual death.</em>
